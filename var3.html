<h1 style="margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 15px">Alcohol Consumption and Happiness by Country</h1>
<div id="div_visuals" style="max-width: 1250px; margin: auto;">
    This visualization can help you explore each country’s beer, wine, and spirit consumption, per capita. <br>
    You can learn about each individual country, or you can assess data at a regional level. <br>
    Alcohol consumption can also be compared against the happiness score of each country, as visualized by the colour on the map. <br>(Grey countries had no data.)<p>
    122 countries are included in the data, and all data is from 2016. The Happiness Score is a metric measured by asking a sample of people from a given population, “How would you rate your happiness on a scale of 0 to 10, where 10 is the happiest?”
    All alcohol consumption data is taken from the World Health Organization.<p>
    Hover over the map or charts to see a tooltip of the alcohol values for that country or region.<br>
